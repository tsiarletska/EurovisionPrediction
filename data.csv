But baby, we both know
This is not our time
It's time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
'Cause this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way
Violins playin' and the angels cryin'
When the stars align, then I'll be there
No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
I'm letting my hair down
I'm takin' it cool
You got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it, my friend
It's all that I got

2023,4,350,11,Italy,Marco Mengoni,Due Vite,"Siamo i soli svegli in tutto l'universo
E non conosco ancora bene il tuo deserto
Forse è in un posto del mio cuore dove il sole è sempre spento
Dove a volte ti perdo, ma se voglio ti prendo
Siamo fermi in un tempo così, che solleva le strade
Con il cielo ad un passo da qui, siamo i mostri e le fate
Dovrei telefonarti, dirti le cose che sento
Ma ho finito le scuse e non ho più difese
Siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra
Il caffè col limone contro l'hangover, sembri una foto mossa
E ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale
E meno male
Se questa è l'ultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà
Sarò lì a dirti che sbagli, ti sbagli e lo sai
Qui non arriva la musica
E tu non dormi e dove sarai? Dove vai?
Quando la vita poi esagera
Tutte le corse, gli schiaffi, gli sbagli che fai
Quando qualcosa ti agita
Tanto lo so che tu non dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi mai
Che giri fanno due vite
Siamo i soli svegli in tutto l'universo
A gridare un po' di rabbia sopra un tetto
Che nessuno si sente così
Che nessuno li guarda più i film
I fiori nella tua camera
La mia maglia metallica
Siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra
Persi tra le persone, quante parole senza mai una risposta
E ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale
E meno male
Se questa è l'ultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà
Sarò lì a dirti che sbagli, ti sbagli e lo sai
Qui non arriva la musica
E tu non dormi e dove sarai? Dove vai?
Quando la vita poi esagera
Tutte le corse, gli schiaffi, gli sbagli che fai
Quando qualcosa ti agita
Tanto lo so che tu non dormi
Spegni la luce anche se non ti va
Restiamo al buio avvolti solo dal suono della voce
Al di là della follia che balla in tutte le cose
Due vite, guarda che disordine
Se questa è l'ultima (canzone e poi la luna esploderà) canzone
Sarò lì a dirti che sbagli, ti sbagli e lo sai
Qui non arriva la musica
Tanto lo so che tu non dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi mai
Che giri fanno due vite

Realized that all the lies I’ve told myself have died
Bring me to the place where I belong
Filled with all the memories and dreams I have ignored

Aaah, aaah, aaah

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

There is one more thing you need to know
That I forgive myself for all the lies I said before
Now I see the road of leading lights
Showing me where I should go and what to leave behind

Aaah, aaah

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

You will find a way
To begin again
No more time to waste
Or to play pretend
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

I remember all the things that I went through
All the lies and blurry lines and city lights I knew
Now I’m strong enough to see what lays inside
And I can feel it all

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

You will find a way
To begin again
No more time to waste

On ne peut toucher le ciel du doigt

C'n'est que du vent

Elle ne sera plus jamais la même

Car moi, je chante
Ma vie, la vôtre et un peu de romance
Je suis nue devant vous
Donnez-moi donc une chance
De vous à moi, de moi à vous
Ai-je réussi à chanter
À chanter la Grande France?

Su una bici di diamanti
Mi hai detto, ""Sei cambiato
Non vedo più la luce nei tuoi occhi""
La tua paura cos'è?
Un mare dove non tocchi mai
Anche se il sesso non è
La via di fuga dal fondo
Dai, non scappare da qui
Non lasciarmi così
Nudo con i brividi
A volte non so esprimermi
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E ti vorrei rubare un cielo di perle
E pagherei per andar via
Accetterei anche una bugia
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E mi vengono i brividi, brividi, brividi
Tu, che mi svegli il mattino
Tu, che sporchi il letto di vino
Tu, che mi mordi la pelle
Con i tuoi occhi da vipera
E tu, sei il contrario di un angelo
E tu, sei come un pugile all'angolo
E tu scappi da qui, mi lasci così
Nudo con i brividi
A volte non so esprimermi
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E ti vorrei rubare un cielo di perle
E pagherei per andar via
Accetterei anche una bugia
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E mi vengono i brividi, brividi, brividi
Dimmi che non ho ragione
E vivo dentro una prigione
E provo a restarti vicino
Ma scusa se poi mando tutto a puttane e
Non so dirti ciò che provo, è un mio limite
Per un ""ti amo"" ho mischiato droghe e lacrime
Questo veleno che ci sputiamo ogni giorno
Io non lo voglio più addosso
Lo vedi, sono qui
Su una bici di diamanti, uno fra tanti
Nudo con i brividi
A volte non so esprimermi
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E ti vorrei rubare un cielo di perle
E pagherei per andar via
Accetterei anche una bugia
E ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
E mi vengono i brividi, brividi, brividi

2022,25,6,13,Germany,Malik Harris,Rockstars,"Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em
I tried getting rid of the pain
I tried to make it go away, but it probably won't change
Always thinking 'bout my own worries
Remember back when we had no worries?
Now life just ain't hitting the same
I sit and miss and reminisce about innocent old days
When I was afraid of nobody
Now I'm afraid of being a nobody
Don't wanna leave my bed
I'll just stay and never get it together
'Cause the voices in my head
They keep saying it'll never get better
Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em
Sometimes I got this kinda sting that's right inside my chest
Its only purpose is convincing me that I'm a mess
And even though it's always been an uninvited guest
It finds a way in nonetheless
Wish I could change my address
And you know
Just be somebody else for a couple of days
Although I'm pretty sure we all feel the same kinda way
'Cause if you think about it
Aren't we all set in a place
Where we look back at better days
And wish they weren't so far away?
I wish that I could just go back and be the way I was
I wish I'd still not give a damn 'bout how I come across
I wish the way I saw myself had never gotten lost
In all the worries, all the thoughts, overthinking all the parts
So exhausted, always caught up inside my doubts and flaws
And I'ma count them all
Somebody catch me, I'm 'bout to fall
Yeah, I'm 'bout to fall
Can we press pause?
Or do a restart
And be who we are?
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
'Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we're in
The good old days before we all just leave 'em
Didn't we?
(We used to be the rockstars)
Didn't we?
(We used to be the rockstars)

Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro, no
Io ho scritto pagine e pagine, ho visto sale poi lacrime
Questi uomini in macchina e non scalare le rapide
Ho scritto sopra una lapide, in casa mia non c'è Dio
Ma se trovi il senso del tempo, risalirai dal tuo oblio
E non c'è vento che fermi la naturale potenza
Dal punto giusto di vista, del vento senti l'ebrezza
Con ali in cera alla schiena ricercherò quell'altezza
Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta, prova a tagliarmi la testa perché
Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro, oh

I didn't become myself before I met you

Takes a little time, so takе a little time
As it ages like wine

How does it keep getting better?
Everyday our love finds a new way to grow
The time we spend together
Hmm, simply feels good
We got a good thing going

And just when I thought that my heart was full
I found places that I never explored
You're so fascinating
And I can't remember the last time I was bored

I don't wanna know what would've happened if I never had had your love
I didn't become myself before I met you
I don't wanna know what would've happened if I never had felt your love

Feels like no tomorrow

Used to call us cheesy
It was paradise in my bed so lonely

Clock is ticking tik-tak
Everything is chik-chak
And I don’t know what to do

Caught up in this moment 'til my heartbeat stops
I've been running barefoot to the mountain tops
Nothing comes as easy as it goes
I can hug the water when it snows
I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone
You pulled my heart, I took it in
It made me someone, I am someone
And now I'm done, I'm coming home
I used to listen to the way they talk
Counting down the minutes from the ticking clock
I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone
You pulled my heart, I took it in
It made me someone, I am someone
And now I'm done, I'm coming
Home was so far, collecting scars, I refuse
Another touch won't be another bruise
I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone
You pulled my heart, I took it in
It made me someone, I am someone
I am standing tall not giving in
'Cause I am someone, I am someone
And now I'm done, I'm coming
Now I'm done, I'm coming
Now I'm done, I'm coming home

2018,5,308,26,Italy,Ermal Meta e Fabrizio Moro,Non Mi Avete Fatto Niente,"Al Cairo non lo sanno che ore sono adesso
Il sole sulla Rambla oggi non è lo stesso
In Francia c’è un concerto
la gente si diverte
qualcuno canta forte
qualcuno grida a morte

A Londra piove sempre ma oggi non fa male
il cielo non fa sconti neanche a un funerale
A Nizza il mare è rosso di fuochi e di vergogna
di gente sull’asfalto e sangue nella fogna

E questo corpo enorme che noi chiamiamo Terra
ferito nei suoi organi dall’Asia all’Inghilterra
galassie di persone disperse nello spazio
ma quello più importante è lo spazio di un abbraccio
Di madri senza figli, di figli senza padri
Di volti illuminati come muri senza quadri
Minuti di silenzio spezzati da una voce
Non mi avete fatto niente

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non mi avete tolto niente
Questa è la mia vita che va avanti
oltre tutto, oltre la gente
Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre

C’è chi si fa la croce
e chi prega sui tappeti
le chiese e le moschee
l’Imàm e tutti i preti
Gli ingressi separati della stessa casa
Miliardi di persone che sperano in qualcosa
Braccia senza mani
Facce senza nomi
Scambiamoci la pelle
in fondo siamo umani
Perché la nostra vita non è un punto di vista
E non esiste bomba pacifista

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non mi avete tolto niente
Questa è la mia vita che va avanti
Oltre tutto, oltre la gente
Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre

Cadranno i grattaceli
e le metropolitane
i muri di contrasto alzati per il pane
ma contro ogni terrore che ostacola il cammino
il mondo si rialza
col sorriso di un bambino
col sorriso di un bambino
col sorriso di un bambino

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre
Non mi avete fatto niente
Le vostre inutili guerre
Non avete avuto niente
Le vostre inutili guerre

Sono consapevole che tutto più non torna
La felicità volava
Come vola via una bolla

E embel e zjarrte
Ca hapa trokasin si zemer kete nate
Une ndjek ritmin e saj
Dy duar qe zgjaten perpijne ne ngrohtesi
Ky mall qe te djeg nuk njeh kufi as largesi
Si me magji hena shikimet perpin
Me sjell vegimin tend
Lot i pathare ndricoje kete nate
Sonte kumbo prej shpirtit pa fjale
Vetem nje cast dhimbja te me ndale
Ky lot i pathare nje dite do shteroje
Nga puthjet e zjarrta qe enderroi
Ne ate cast dhimbja do ndaloje
Dua te hesht ne kete nate i shtrire ne kete shtrat
Ku endrrat hyjnore sherojne cdo plage
Te shoh portretin e saj
Momentet kalojne
Sekondat nuk falin
Oret pasojne por ndjenjen se ndalin, jo
Si me magji hena shikimet perpin
Syte tane puqen serish
Edhe pse eshte fantazi
Jeten do ta fal ty

That day, the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again
From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh-oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah-ah
When we're old, ah-ah
No matter what comes our way
I feel like you're here to stay
You were the right from the start
And let me inside your heart
After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave I would-
These are the reasons
I want you to know, oh-oh
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh-oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote

I knew it'll end up like this
I'm not afraid to grow old
If I have your hand to hold"

I thought we’d be together ’til we die
I’ll forever wonder why
I thought we’d be together ’til we die
I’ll forever wonder why

Why have you been coming home so late in the evening?
Is there someone else that I should know about?
‘Cause there’s a smile on your face that I haven’t seen
Since we started going out

How could true love, look me in the eye and lie, lie?

I thought we’d be together ’til we die
I’ll forever wonder why
I thought we’d be together ’til we die
I’ll forever wonder why
I’ll forever wonder why

And then you chose to break my heart
Remember right back to the start

Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
If you knew me you’d be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
She’ll be back home till sunrise

Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma

Yodele, yodele ee-oh! (Aha, yeah!)
You never show the spark that makes you glow
You always run away, you always say no to the right things
Don't try to hide the light inside of you
Today might be the day when you will make it baby
So bring it on, bring it on, I'm a dreamer
If you don't believe it, come and see me I will teach you
If you never try, you'll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride

Now what's the use of being so confused?
Of doing all this work you really don't want to be doing?
But you'll be fine, it's time to feel alive
Don't stop from reaching for the stars and keep on moving
So bring it on, bring it on, I'm a dreamer
If you don't believe it, come and see me, I will teach ya

Sitting alone at my desk on a 9 to 5 program, it just won't do
Get another coffee, get another one to make it through
Don't want this anymore
Don't you hide that light inside of you
Come and show me what you wanna do
If you're stuck in a place, feeling incomplete
If you wanna run feeling like a misfit
Come on sing along
Come on sing this song

Hogy meghódítsd a szívem

Kínlódtam már eleget
De az Isten lát engem
Miért hazudtad azt nekem
Hogy nem számít a színem
Tudtad barna a szemem
Sosem változik bennem
Nem kérek már belőled
Menj el innen hagyj engem
Ne is lássalak téged
Átkozott légy örökre
Engem négyévesen megszólított az Isten
Egy igazi fegyvert adott a kezembe
Tudtam csak ő vigyázhat rám
Többet gyakoroltam vele mint egy szamuráj
Benne bízhatok, mindig az igazat mondja
Vele sírhatok, de az utat mutatja
Egy olyan szövetség, ami marad örökké
Fel nem áldozható, ő a legfőbb kincsem
Sejtelmes erők laktak a gyerekben
Féltek tőle, látszik a szemekben
A húrjaim támadnak, sírnak a testekben
Hiába is véded ki, méreg a hangszerben
Nagy tömegeket itattam át vele
Hallod a dallamom, már tudod a nevemet

I don't care if I'm falling
I'm gonna grab the moment

Try to stand straight, but I'm boneless
Gotta pocket full of prose, while I'm walking on my toes
And I'm coping with a map that is roadless
Got eyes in my neck, but I'm absent
Quiet in a corner seeking action
I wanna be bold, but I'm only getting old
I need to stop drowning in distractions
So when it's all or nothing
Better get that good vibe buzzing
So when it's all or nothing

Though the hallway catches light
It won't reach the corner where you strongly fight
Here, in the shadow
At this place, they know the game
Outside, the world will turn and feel the same
There, in the sunlight
But you are so much more to me
Than the one who carries all the burden
I can only hope, once you fly, you'll be free
You should never
Cry no more, feelin' all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line and not give up, but walk that road
That everybody goes
Through lights and shadows
Every time the candle glows
It lightens up the space, but no one knows
Will there be a dark side?
Every battle's victory
Is a double feeling when you cannot be
Here, in the spotlight
'Cause you are so much more to me
Than the one who lifts us on your shoulders
I can only hope, once you fly, you'll be free
You should never
Cry no more, feelin' all alone and insecure

Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line and not give up, but walk that road
That everybody goes
Through lights and shadows
On a scale of one to ten
You got the biggest score, you're heaven sent
No one will doubt that you're an angel
So what went wrong this time?
Hurt nobody, did no crime
What's with the universe? Why you?
Cry no more, feelin' all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line and not give up, but walk that road

But all the battles are in vain
You mean more than anything to me

E farsi strada nel mio petto senza spegnere la voce
E non sentire più tensione solo vita dentro di me

Nessun tipo di esitazione
Non c'è più nessuna divisione fra di noi
Siamo una sola direzione in questo universo che si muove
Non c'è nessun grado di separazione
Davo meno spazio al cuore e più alla mente
Sempre un passo indietro e l'anima in allerta
E guardavo il mondo da una porta
Mai completamente aperta e non da vicino
E no, non c'è alcuna esitazione finalmente dentro di me
There is no degree of separation
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us

Dancing through the sky, we are shining

Il profumo dolce della pelle sua
È una voce dentro che mi sta portando dove nasce il sole.
Sole sono le parole
Ma se vanno scritte tutto può cambiare
Senza più timore te lo voglio urlare questo grande amore
Amore, solo amore è quello che sento
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando vedo, vedo solo te
Dimmi perché quando credo, credo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai.
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d'amore.
Dimmi che sai
Che solo me sceglierai
Ora lo sai
Tu sei il mio unico grande amore
Passeranno primavere,
Giorni freddi e stupidi da ricordare,
Maledette notti perse a non dormire altre a far l'amore
Amore, sei il mio amore
Per sempre, per me.
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando amo, amo solo te
Dimmi perché quando vivo, vivo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai.
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d'amore.

Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace

I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
As I got outside, I smiled to the dog

I didn't wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Lets try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

Why would you think like that?
Yeah we fight a lot but in the end
You and I we're a perfect match
I wouldn't want it any other way
But now your gone and I'm all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone

I didn't wanna wake you up

Undermining me, now at last I see

I’m feeling cold, and I’m
Out of my mind, without you
My head is spinning like a top
Back to the time we had a lot…going on
Now my world lies shattered
How quickly life can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

One day you think you have it all
The next you’re staring at the wall…in a dream
The road that once was paved with gold
Has turned a rusty shade
Of all the saddest colours in the world
Now my life’s in tatters
How quickly it all can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done          I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there

I didn’t do everything for you
But I tried so hard and that’s the truth
I’d make you feel you were really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

I nearly did everything for you
But I broke your heart, now mine’s broken too
In your hour of need, I didn’t come…..
That’s the one thing I should……..have done"

Well, don't get on the wrong train
Don't fly in an old plane
Don't go out in the pouring rain
You might get wet I'd be upset
You're bound to get sneezes
Or nasty diseases
Take good care when I'm not there
I'm still in love with you
While I'm on vacation
You be a good patient
Take your medication
I worry so each time I go
Try to keep warm, dear
In case there's a storm, dear
Take good care while I'm not there
I'm still in love with you
Some younger guys with roving eyes
May tantalise you with their lies
You must be wise and realise
Leave well alone till you get home, dear
Won't see other fellas,
Don't wanna make you jealous
No need to fear when you're not here
I'm still in love with you
Let's dance, dance
Dance
Don't walk on the red light
Don't stay out at midnight
Don't get in a fist fight
That pretty face can't be replaced
Won't be out at night, hon
It wouldn't be right hon
No need to fear when you're not here
I'm still in love with you

You take care now, honey
Don't make a fuss, you need to trust me
This is how it always must be
When I stop to think of us
I can assure you, I adore you
Because you're so gorgeous
You need to be cautious
Take good care when I'm not there
I'm still in love with you
You have a fun time,
And soak up that sunshine
But don't drink too much wine
Just one or two will have to do
I know what you're thinking
So I won't be drinking
No need to fear when you're not here
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you"
2015,25,4,2,France,Lisa Angell,N'oubliez Pas,"Il ne me reste que des larmes
Ces quelques notes venues d'autrefois
Et le chant de nos prières
Nos cœurs qui espèrent
Et le vide sous mes pas
Il ne me reste que les cendres
De mon village plongé dans le silence
Je ne suis qu'une blessure
Un cœur sans armure
Comment survivre après ça?
Mais, je suis là
Je n'oublie pas
Dans mon village balayé par l'histoire
Et je vis là
N'oubliez pas
Effacée des cartes et des mémoires
Je me souviens du rire des enfants
La voix des hommes, quand, ils partaient aux champs
Les fêtes des moissons
L'odeur dans les maisons
Les éclats d'amour et de joie
Mais je suis là
N'oubliez-pas
Effacée des cartes et des mémoires
Quand ils sont arrivés
Cachés derrière leurs armes
Ils étaient des milliers
Ils riaient de nos larmes
Ils ont voulu détruire
Nos croyances et nos âmes
Avec des mots de haine
Que l'on ne connaissait pas
Je suis ici ce soir
Au milieu de ces ruines
Pour vous parler d'espoir
Et vous chanter la vie
Et je fais le serment
Quand séchera le sang
De reconstruire ma ville
Bien plus belle qu'un port
Mais n'oubliez pas"

So anytime that you've got a yearning
Don't you know, anytime, any place, I am yours

Everything that I could ever want
If you ever need me, I'm waiting on you

Of stolen kisses, I got the answer

You know you're hard to read
Because the face I see is not the one I know
And when you call me ""Baby""
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know who you are, how long can we pretend?
See the change I know
We both don't have the heart to say
Can't return to what we burn
We'll never be the same
'Cause you said you'd never let me go
And I said I can but now we know
That it's too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work
When there's nothing left to talk about
'Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know
We're only left with smoke
Black smoke
We're only left with smoke
Black smoke
I try to tell myself
That it's all in my head
But the truth remains, we're just too far apart
You know we're fooling ourselves if we hold on
'Cause we're fighting for something that we don't want
Just leave it now and walk away
See the change I know
We both don't have the heart to say
Can't return to what we burn
We'll never be the same
'Cause you said you'd never let me go

Walking over glass
Neighbors say we're trouble
Well that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be
You wouldn't know me at all today from the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me
'Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution, you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned

Once I'm reborn

Livin' in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can't be for you

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry?

I could say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm"

And say that I belong
I'll wait forever and a lifetime

Ask myself
What comes next
Will I fly?​
Will I fall?

E dimmi se c'è davvero una meta

Stringo forte il tuo respiro
E penso a me che non ho un freno
Spingo forte, non ti temo
Voglio tutto, voglio te
Voglio te, voglio te, voglio te
Amo il traffico in centro, parcheggiare distratta
Il tuo sorriso, la mia instabilità
Amo fare l'offesa senza neanche una scusa, fare pace la sera
Spegni la città
E amo me stessa per questo per egocentrismo
Senza razionalità
Amo prenderti in giro sapendo di tornare sempre

People gathering by to breathe the morning air,
but no one sees the bitter cold and shivering empty hands
A school girl running by and trying to beat the bell.
People dropping, tossing coins in wishing wells,
but no one cares for dreams that don't fit into our world
Maybe nightfall darkens skies
And maybe teardrops stain our eyes
But may the slightest light start a fire
A soldier in the hands of a forgotten mess
Digging out the burning bullets in his chest
So eager, bold and noble – printing footsteps on this earth
Maybe nightfall darkens skies
Maybe teardrops stain our eyes
But may the slightest light start a fire

Start a fire

What if we all opened our arms?
What if we came together as one?
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?
What if we chose to bury our guns?

Why don’t we always reach out to those
Who need us the most?"

Μας βρήκε η τρικυμία μέσα στην Εγνατία
Μποφόρια μας τραβάνε στα ανοιχτά
Σα λάθος να' ναι η ρότα, ποιος παίζει με τα φώτα;
Και η πλόρη μας τραβάει για Γρεβενά

[Verse 1]
Σε μια θάλασσα ουίσκι
Ναυαγοί και ποιος μας βρίσκει
Και ζαλίζεται τρεγκλίζει, όλη η γη
Με κεφάλι σουρωτήρι
Και τ' αμάξι τρεχαντίρι
Ποιος του έβαλε πηδάλιο και πανί;

[Chorus]
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free
Alcohol is free, alcohol is free

[Verse 2]
Κύμα και λυσσομανάει
Και η γοργόνα να ρωτάει
Μα ο Αλέκος τα' χει πιει καλή κυρά
Μεσοπέλαγα φανάρι
Ρε μας πήρανε χαμπάρι
Ποιος το πήγε το σπιτάκι μου μακριά, μακριά

[Interlude]
Μας βρήκε η τρικυμία μέσα στην Εγνατία
Μποφόρια μας τραβάνε στα ανοιχτά
Σα λάθος να' ναι η ρότα, ποιος παίζει με τα φώτα;
Και η πλόρη μας τραβάει για Γρεβενά
Μας βρήκε η τρικυμία μέσα στην Εγνατία
Μποφόρια μας τραβάνε στα ανοιχτά
Σα λάθος να' ναι η ρότα, ποιος παίζει με τα φώτα;
Και η πλόρη μας τραβάει για Γρεβενά

[Verse 3]
Δε μας φταίγαν τα ουισκάκια
Μπόμπα ήταν τα παγάκια
Και το σκάφος έχει ρόδες, τελικά
Αλκοτέστ και τροχονόμος
Δεν είναι για μας ο δρόμος
Κατηφόρα μες την θάλασσα, αρχινά

[Chorus]

2013,7,126,23,Italy,Marco Mengoni,L'Essenziale,"Sostengono gli eroi
""Se il gioco si fa duro, è da giocare""
Beati loro poi
Se scambiano le offese con il bene
Succede anche a noi
Di far la guerra e ambire poi alla pace
E nel silenzio mio
Annullo ogni tuo singolo dolore
Per apprezzare quello che
Non ho saputo scegliere
E mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Che da sempre sei per me l'essenziale
Non accetterò
Un altro errore di valutazione
L'amore è in grado di
Celarsi dietro amabili parole
Che ho pronunciato prima che
Fossero vuote e stupide
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Mi allontano dagli eccessi e dalle cattive abitudini
Tornerò all'origine
E torno a te, che sei per me l'essenziale
L'amore non segue le logiche
Ti toglie il respiro e la sete
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Mi allontano dagli eccessi e dalle cattive abitudini
Tornerò all'origine
E torno a te, che sei per me l'essenziale"

His name is Jeremy, working in IT
Never questions why he has always been
An extra careful guy, sensitive and shy
Risk assessment is his investment in a life of no surprise
'Til she walked into his life
She's spontaneous indeed, uncertainty's her creed
She has always been neither black or white
Just a curious delight
She threw affection in his direction, a collection of her smiles
And to his surprise, woah-oh
She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow, she is always one day away
All the time she slips away it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow, woah-oh
Time to follow her tomorrow, woah-oh
He fell for her too fast, we all thought it wouldn't last
'Cause good ol' Jeremy likes his rigorous routine
'Cause he only thinks today (today) but tomorrow is a way (a way)
To find a new direction and you'll be okay
She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow, she is always one day away
All the time she slips away it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow, oh-oh

Time to follow her tomorrow, oh-oh
Time to follow her tomorrow, oh-oh
She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, and she just wants to play

One day away (one day away)
One day away (one day away)

Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wander off
Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hope's turned into fear
With my one wing I can't fly
With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
When memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why

2013,12,71,6,Belgium,Roberto Bellarosa,Love Kills,"So the arrow shot right through her heart and brought her to the cold
And she felt so deep like she had never felt so deep before
But the pain was almost unbelievable
When the end was near she felt the fear alive, alive, alive
Waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over again
'Cause he didn't fight for life when he was up against the wall
And he felt so scared for both of them, even though they had it all
There's a lesson that you always have to learn
To the consequence of fire comes the burn
Waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over again
One last, one last, one last prayer's for life
Won't you give me, give me hope tonight?
I'll be waiting for the bitter pill, give me something I can feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill, something I can truly feel
'Cause love kills over and over, love kills over and over again"

Talking 'bout our destiny

I'd survive it all because of you

Whenever I've got days of doubt
bringing me down
So even if disaster strikes I close my eyes and then I'm next to you
I'm right there with you

And my body just started moving
I was really shaking down
Something happened when I was dancing
I could feel that powerful beat
Taking me to new dimensions
Waking up the devil in me
A heavenly chorus and love all around

Kuda, ne pitam, jer ako pitam, ti šutiš
I sve se teže rastajem od tebe i tvog tijela
I sve te manje poznajem a nisam tako htjela
K'o da kradem te od svih samo za sebe
Nek' te ostave, nek' mi ne diraju tebe
I krv i dušu otrujem najgore kad te ranim
I opet sve to prezirem dok se pred tobom branim
Nemoj mi kvariti dan, nikad mi nije bilo teže
Ti nisi živio sam u zlatu paukove mreže
Kao ja, život za tebe me veže
Da l' će ikad lakše sve biti il' teže, ej...
Kad jednom cijeli život naš mirno na kocku staviš
K'o da nismo nikad rekli mi, ""dok nas smrt ne rastavi""
Nemoj mi kvariti dan, nikad mi nije bilo teže
Ti nisi živio sam u zlatu paukove mreže

Throw a rope, grab a hold

At dawn they will be free
 
Memories they haunt his mind
Save him from the endless night
She wispers warm and tenderly:
""Please come back to me""
 
And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades
Forever we'll be free
 
Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all, my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know we'll be one
'Cause I still believe that you'll remember me

Remembering when they said goodbye
Where's the one he used to know?
It seems so long ago

If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free
Trust in your dreams, run with no fear
And if you should stumble remember I'm near
As a ghost I will walk, I'll look deep in my soul
I might find another, you gave me that hope
So as you kiss him in the moonlight
With heavy words I say
If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever and the hurt will run deep

Are running out of time
So maybe I should get a nine to five
And I don't wanna let it go
There's so much more to life
Tell me, did I get it wrong?
Tell me everything will be okay
And before I fall
Tell me they'll play my songs
And tell me they'll sing the words I'll sing
When darkness falls
All of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar
Surely I'll find my way
'Cause I'm not afraid to try
Even a world of love and hope
Can't guarantee that prize
So maybe I should get a nine to five

When I was a little child
Mama told me you should know
Our world is cruel and wild
But to make your way through cold and heat
Love is all that you need

[Pre-Chorus]

More than anything I heard
But I was too scared to lose my fun
I began to cry a lot
And she gave me apricots
Kisses of the earth, fruits of the sun

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

I will drop it down
In the frozen ground
Let it, let it make its round                        Apricot stone

Shining brightly in the storm
And I've got an avatar
Of my love to keep me warm
Now I'm not afraid of violent winds
They may blow - they can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
May the winter stay away
From my harvest night and day
May God bless and keep my cherished fruit
Grow my tree up to the sky
Once I waved my home goodbye
I just want to go back to my roots

I hope some day you'll say my name out loud

tell me about your feelings,
Tell me about your stories

And make me immortal with a kiss

tell me about your feelings,

Wise men talking, tales from the old
I reach for the stars,
wherever they are, in darkness
We’re lost, fading away


What if we, could be free?
Mystify, our wisdom in time
and one day we’ll see

What if we, found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lies
and learn how to be


All the madness feeding our soul
Take a wild guess out of control
There will be a star,
nomatter how far, shining
One day we’ll sail away


What if we, could be free?
Mystify, our wisdom in time
and one day we’ll see

What if we, found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lies
and learn how to be


If you don’t know your destination
Who determines your destiny?


What if we, could be free?

and one day we’ll see


What if we, found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lies

I’ve done it all as a little child
But the pain that I have
For the fame that I got, was for what?

A little girl is crying alone
A little boy searching for his home
Even after I’ve sinned for a heart-craving dream
Is that a sin?


If you really love the love you say
You’ll love with a love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say
You’ll love with a love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love will love you back
Will love you back




For just one moment, we all wanna be
Just as happy as one can be
So don’t you make the same mistake
You’d better give from what you take
And don’t you break

A little girl or boy crying at home alone
That faithful song will lead the way
To make you strong


If you really love the love you say
You’ll love with a love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say
You’ll love with a love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love will love you back

If you really love
If you really love the love you say
You’ll love with a love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say

Will love you back

Love can be hard sometimes
Yes, it can catch you off guard like bad crimes
Yes, it can make you depressed and angry
Make you say: ""Why me, why won't anybody try me?""

""Ooh, I don't wanna be by myself""
""Ooh, don't wanna be lonely""
""Why ain't anybody lovin' me?""

There is always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong

Love can go away forever if you push it
And you have to remember don't rush it
If it ain't right, it is wrong
And you'll be crying: ""Why me, why won't anybody try me?""

All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get

[Verse 2]
If you have the greatest aim
Keep it in your soul
I'll be always by your side
Always in your heart                           [Pre - Chorus]
Our dreams can play with us
Even if we think that we keep control
From all horrors of the world
Salvation is love, love

[Chorus]
The earth is in flame
And you must share the blame
Look inside yourself
We both are there

[Bridge]
Day after day
Day after day
Day...

[Outro]
Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get"

כשגעגוע מול ירח כאן לרגע ובורח
אחריו רודף הבכי
זה קשה, זה קשה
כשגעגוע מול ירח כאן לרגע ובורח
אחריו רודף הבכי
ואחרי הכל תמיד מגיע שיר
רגע טוב עכשיו אתה יותר קרוב

לא אור כוכב
אתה עכשיו
איתי, איתי, כאילו אמיתי
כמו אז מזמן

Come along, come along
See the fire in your eyes
And you come with me, with me
לפעמים מביא הרוח ריח טוב, מוכר
מלטף, עכשיו שומע...

לא אור כוכב
אתה עכשיו
איתי, איתי, כאילו אמיתי

Weeping for the people lost in fear
While we fight for nothing my eyes run dry
Are you still so blind to ask me why...why
Say it out loud, peace will come
Everybody shout, peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change
Say it out loud, peace will come
Everybody shout, peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come
Sometimes words kill faster than bullets do
And the face of war is never true
Kids with guns are always too young to die
Are you still so deaf to ask me why...why
My land is still crying
Torn in half
My world is slowly dying
My heart is only crying
Peace and love"

For happiness to come my way

I opened my eyes

This is my life

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be

Were just a blessing in disguise
If I never made a single mistake
I wouldn't be here
Part of the plan I believe

This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings
All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be

To set myself free
You'll be amazed
'Cause I have the power
To change my ways

I mogu ti reći da između ove
I milijun drugih pjesama ne postoji razlika

Jer život taj za nama briše tragove
U dobru noć on pušta čudne vragove
Pa svaki san je hladnim suncem obasjan
A sjećanja su skoro sva ugasnula

Da pitaš me još samo jedno znao bi
Da boje sve tek s ovom rimom postoje
A noć i dan su nekog stiha trag
I nestat će kad sve naše pjesme izblijede

Zasvirajte noćas tu romancu
Tiho, nježno da me razboli
Tugu kad umire slavuj
Kad se duša s tijelom razdvoji

Zasvirajte noćas tu romancu
Al polako da je čuju svi
Neka opet sviraju gitare
Već odavno nisam sluš'o njih

Govore mi danas da sam u banani
Tehnološki otpad ko majmun na grani
A ja sam bio prvi Internet na svijetu
Na brodovima s glazbom umrežio planetu

Pamtim i sad sve snove svojih pjesama
Sva maštanja i lica što su nestala
Ko sjene su još dio mojih buđenja
Zarobljena u mene, davno utkana

Zasvirajte noćas tu romancu
Tiho, nježno da me razboli
Tugu kad umire slavuj
Kad se duša s tijelom razdvoji

Zasvirajte noćas tu romancu
Al polako da je čuju svi
Neka opet sviraju gitare
Već odavno nisam sluš'o njih

to be bullied and i'll tell you now it isn't nice,
It isn't nice wouldn't wish it upon anyone,
so i'll tell you my story and my story from how it begun

Moved to Blackpool thought it was a nice place
Moved to a school at first yeah it was great
Got along with people and I had all my new friends,
turned out they were snakes, bullies in the end
And I, was a new girl that rumors went around
Shouting as they all walked past her
From here it all went down
Now the people turned against me
And now I lost all my mates
And I lost everyone there wasn't much more I could take and I,
got called names as I walked along the corridor
Weeks passed got worse couldn't take it anymore
Ran away, put my mum through so much stress
But my story doesn't end yet you haven't heard the rest
I was lost and had nobody put my mind to the test,
but my story doesn't end yeah you haven't heard the rest
Ran away, put my mum through so much stress
But my story doesn't end yet you haven't heard the rest
[Hook x2]

Keep on fighting,
cause every cloud has a silver lining
Gotta be strong be a soldier,
forget what them bullies told ya

[Verse 2]

Got messages often saying I should die,
and by this point I had enough of my life
So I got into the bedroom, locked the door,
got hold of all these tablets,
took loads and took some more
It was an overdose, and I didn't tell anyone
No one noticed till the morning didn't realise what I'd done
Saw that look in my mum's eyes
That look I'd never forget,
and then my mind fills with emotion,
and then it fills with regret
She was scared shocked and I didn't know what to do
So we phoned an ambulance, didn't wanna tell the truth,
and we informed the school,
seems it didn't care
So they put me in a room everyday, it weren't fair
Why did I get all the punishment for all that I've been through?
When you get something like this
You think it's taken from you,
Months later..
Things didn't change I would self harm,
Run away still full of pain but,
This was my fight and I weren't gonna lose
Thought it would be hard in the end it's just a bruise
Now I'm the girl, with one million views,
and I've learnt to ignore to the people who will disapprove
Don't judge a book by it's cover,
because you don't know what you'll find
I'm Sophie Aspin and this story is mine
Sophie Aspin and this story is mine,
so R.I.P. to the angels that took their own lives....

And from Lisadell to Latvia
We're singing as one clan
The curtain has been raised
And Europe's all one stage
And the archipelagic icicles
Have melted like the cage
We don't need no party
Just a party band
A continental choir
Singing hand in hand
They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring
They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

It seems we're playing a game
Easy smile, but no fun
Sweet music for no one
Close embrace, but no more
Cold champagne we forgot to pour

Sirens, barking dogs
Thank God for the one and only sound

Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

Oh, as sensitive people we're trampled
Almost everywhere we go
There are days when we'll die
If one more stranger tells us no
So I hope your shadows melt away
As you say they've done before
Just like the one and only sound
That turns around for me once more                                              I hear your heart
Whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too? Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart
Whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart
Can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart
Mine too?
I hear your heart

A violin on a summer night
On a full moon mountain top
Couldn't sound as sweet as you do
Don't stop, don't stop

No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through

2006,18,26,9,Denmark,Sidsel Ben Semmane,Twist Of Love,"Once upon a time there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda shy and so in love with Connie
But so was O'Smarty, who played it cool
The king of the party, but oh what a fool
He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist
(Twist, he didn't know how to twist)
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist
Once upon a night there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda high and dancing with his honey
The queen of the party proclaimed him king
While poor old O'Smarty was left in the ring
He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove

A twist of pain
A twist of me and you
A twist of things you can't explain
Will make your dream come true

""What did you learn at school today?""

Dwelling on the past, from back when I was young
Thinking of my school days and trying to write this song
Classroom schemes and dreams, man, they couldn't save me
'Cause my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy (Avy)
Teenage kicks running out, what could we do?
I still show respect to my boys who made it through
And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
Then giving him a signal, so everyone could see (could see)
Sunshine and shade, those girls I'd serenade
Thinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave (whatever)
Hoping that those days would go on and on forever
Every day something new, just friends running together (together)
But suddenly school ends, your teenage life's gone (lifes gone)
All your mates are growing up now, they're moving on (moving on)
And now I'm looking back, I'll tell you what I know
Do you listen to your teacher? No, I don't think so

But they don't know, don't understand, do they?

When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life
Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine (yeah yeah)
Ooh ooh ooh... shine ( we all will shine) (hear me now)
And if you give the kids time, they won't do the crime (No, No)
Won't do the crime (give them a little time)
Now my bad old ways were during my school days
Messing on those grade A's, my life is just a haze
I'm going through the struggle, five ten and kicking back
So I could lock my flow, lace it up now on the track
Oh yeah, I felt the pain, whilst chasing all the fame
I'm being told I'm nothing, just a player in the game
But now I walk tall, stand proud for you to see
I'm driving these fast cars, it's five stars for me
""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know, don't understand, do they? (don't know nothing)
Why do they always give advice? (always giving advice yeah)

Wanna get through now, can't wait another day

How... Oh how! Do I reach inside you?

And lights up again

Many natural highs

Wenn du schläfst, dann träum ich mit dir mit

More than yourself

When the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid to move on
Lay down with someone strange
Dare to be the same, as always in time
Slowly seek the end at it's glory
Wherever to see, if it's gone
Deep inside

Truth will keep the light shining brighter.

Ti polako za njim kreni ali sam
Jer izgubiti ceš igru
Ovu igru koju odavno vec znam
Ne brini, ne brini za mene
Laž mi ništa ne može
Kaži, kaži kako je
Kada se gubi sve
Pred svima govoriš da ništa ne patiš
Da me ne voliš, baby
Sad, važi, pokaži
Da možeš bez mene
Jer samo dvije rijeci
Danas ti želim reci
Bar, bar, bar za kraj
Ne brini, ne brini za mene
Laž mi ništa ne može
Kaži, kaži kako je
Kada se gubi sve
Ma samo dvije rijeci
Danas ti želim reci
Bar, bar, bar za kraj
Kaži, kaži kako je
Kada se gubi sve
Ne brini, ne brini za mene
Laž mi ništa ne može
Kaži, kaži kako je
Kada se gubi sve"
2003,17,25,17,Greece,Mando,Never Let You Go,"I don't know what I'm going through
Close my eyes, still see you inside
Everything reminds me of you
I could never let you go
I can't hide my feelings at all
I give you love, sometimes it's so hard
Without you I know why I would fall
I could never let you go
I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line
I can't hide from you
Then I'd die for you
But I'd never let you go
What we share keeps me alive
For you there's nothing
I would deny
All I know is I want you so
I could never let you go
I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line
I can't hide from you
Then I'd die for you
But I'd never let you go, never let you go
I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life
On the line
I can't hide from you
Reach the sky for you
But I'd never let you go
Never let you go"

Où es-tu mon amour ?

J'ai connu la joie et puis la douleur
J'étais avec toi, je suis sans demeure

Aucun jour de pluie, seulement du soleil
Je sais qu'il faudrait ne plus en parler
Et moi, j'ai pas fini de t'aimer.

Oui, je connais mon coeur
Je le sais à l'affût
Un souvenir, même un leurre
Et tout le sang reflux

Je suis nue et sans ailes

Ne plus en parler...
...un peu d' oublier
Des monts et merveilles...

Ne plus en parler...

2003,24,5,21,Latvia,F.L.Y.,Hello From Mars,"Time would pass me by if I
Had never asked you why
Your eyes were open wide
That day you saw me cry
I'm not that kind of girl
Who only dreams of pearls
Just give me wings of love
And make it real
'Cause I'm not afraid of a blade
That we need to cross today
But I'm scared to be shared
By someone else
'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars
My emotions take me high
They seem to reach the sky
I still believe we try
To hit the ground or fly
I'm not afraid of a blade
That we need to cross today
But I'm scared to be shared
By someone else
'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars
'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars
Life is a mystery
Like a perfect harmony
No one knows the day when love
Will come and set you free
'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars
'Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to earth
To say hello from Mars"

2002,8,72,12,Sweden,Afro-dite,Never Let It Go,"All right, girls
(Are you shaking?)
Surrounded by sharp-looking eyes
Dancing in a fever
Forgetting all the words of advice
Moving in and closer
What a life we have
What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now
Blinded by the scent of your love
Sailing on this feeling
And my mind is high up above
I don't know if I'm dreaming
What a life we have
What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(We'll be shaking)
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
(We will reach the top)
Surrender to the beat, up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
What a life we have
What a life we live
And when the night is over
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
I'll take you in my arms
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat, up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(Shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking)
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now
So, never let it go
Never stop 'til you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight

So, never let it go, never stop"
2002,9,71,21,Romania,Monica Anghel & Marcel Pavel,Tell Me Why,"We are behaving like two strangers in the gloomy night
We have lost so many feelings in this endless fight
If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

[Chorus]
Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to share together

[Verse 2]
If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

[Chorus]
Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Why we broke our wings in flight
Tell me why couldn't we just try
To forgive and believe we can reach the sky

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to share together                [Outro]
Tell me why"
2002,10,55,7,Russia,Prime minister,Northern Girl,"In all my wanderings around the world
I met so many kinds of pretty girls
All of them like precious stones sparkling on their own
I found them fiery, tender, bright and sweet
In Rome and Paris, Lisbon and Madrid
But one girl remains for me still a real mystery
I've been thinkin' about you

[Chorus]
Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

[Verse 2]
We drink the sunset like ruby wine
But still you keep your head and hold the line
Even when you look aside, I admire your pride
We stand together closely, skin to skin
You look forbidding as the Snow Queen
But I hear your secret call 'cause your fortress has no walls
I'm still thinkin' about you                                                  Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl                       Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

[Bridge]
And when you ask me tonight why I search for love so, so far
I will hold you and whisper:
You're my Northern Star, guiding star, baby

[Chorus]
Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

[Last - Chorus]
Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
(You're my northern girl)
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
(You're my guiding star)
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
(Northern girl)
Northern girl

2002,11,44,6,Croatia,Vesna Pisarovic,Everything I Want,"Since you came into my life
I've been touched by happiness
I feel love is all around
'cos there is no more loneliness
And there's one thing that is true
You should know how much I love you
Love is everything I want,
love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met
as a sign of destiny
Love is everything I want,
I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel
because my love is real
The girl I was I left behind,
incomplete and insecure
Now I got you on my mind
and I feel like I've been cured
And there's one thing that is true
You should know how much I love you
Love is everything I want,
love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met
as a sign of destiny
Love is everything I want,
I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel
because my love is real
Love is everything I want,
love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met
as a sign of destiny
Love is everything I want,
I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel
because my love is real
Love is everything I want,
love is everything I need
Thinking of the day we met
as a sign of destiny
Love is everything I want,
I believe in you and me
Let me show you what I feel
because my love is real.

2002,12,37,10,Israel,Sarit Hadad,Light A Candle,"לפעמים נדמה שאין תקווה
והכל נראה כל כך אפל ולא ידוע
הפרחים עוד לא פרחו בגן ובשדה
ובערב רק מכה הרוח
אז בואו ונדליק ביחד נר, נר

Light a candle
Light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark
Will open our hearts

לפעמים נראה שהמחר
לא יביא כל נחמה לבכי ולצער
והלילה הארוך נמשך בלי הבטחה
והאפלה חדה כתער
אז בואו ונדליק ביחד נר, נר

Light a candle
Light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark
Will open our hearts

Light all the candles
Let's light the candles everywhere
Just look at me and take my hand
The heat of love will glow again"

Once upon a time, I was looking for a girl like you

Sister – come and move your body
Sister – so come on and make my day
'Cause I'm in love, and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say

Oh yeah, that's what I wanna say, honey
Come on

When a boy becomes a man, guess you better know the chance you take
Don't you play your game so fast 'cause a broken heart's the price to pay
So let me try and make it better
'Cause there's so much more that we can do
That's why I'm telling you

Sister – come and move your body
Sister – so come on and make my day

2002,13,33,22,Slovenia,Sestre,Samo Ljubezen,"Srce veliko, kakor svet
Nasmeh in iskrica v očeh
In beseda, poznaš jo tudi ti
V življenju mnogo je poti
Ne išči sreče kjer je ni
Ne poslušaj, kar srce ti govori
Lahko ti podarim samo ljubezen
Eno in edino upanje
Poglej me v oči
In lahko si brez skrbi
Vem, da isto čutiš tudi ti
(Kar želiš si, to ni greh
To je ljubezen v očeh)
Poznaš me bolj kot se ti zdi
Čeprav zatiskaš si oči
Ko me gledaš, vidiš to, kar si
Dolgo časa si iskal
Kar si mislil, da je prav
A na koncu
Le eno boš izbral
Lahko ti podarim samo ljubezen
Eno in edino upanje
Poglej me v oči
In lahko si brez skrbi
Vem, da isto čutiš tudi ti
Lahko ti podarim samo ljubezen
Eno in edino upanje
Poglej me v oči
In lahko si brez skrbi
Saj jo v srcu čutiš tudi ti
Saj jo v srcu čutiš, tudi ti"

Please don't go, I know you're hurt, lilacs have faded in your heart
Remember those days of love, but now no more
When you're gone, I'm so blue
It's so sad and lonely without you

Don't ever let love pass you by

2002,20,24,13,Finland,Laura,Addicted To You,"You don't know how I was then
All broken up, my pride was stolen
I lived a little lie
I wouldn't show the hurting inside
I was living in emptiness
I was out of love
Guard my heart, my wall was so high
You came in with all your confidence
You swept me away off the ground
You taught me to fly
Holding on until the next time
I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug
I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say goodbye
I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard
I'm so addicted to you
I'm
Addicted to you
Addicted to you
Addicted to you
I'm so addicted to you
Why couldn't this be simple
We'd live just like the other people
Now that you're far away
My missing is so constant heartache
'Cause those sparkles back in my eyes
I wish I could stay just like this
Don't want you to go
When you're far away
Fantasize that you're in my arms
And I jump when I hear the phone
Holding on until the next time
I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug
I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say goodbye
I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard
I'm so addicted to you
Addiction, it's hitting hard
Now it's got it's hold
Oh, I can't let go

You’re the rhythm of my heartbeat at night

You're the only melody that's in my soul
And in my mind all the time

I can’t live without music
Only you keep me goin’ along
I can't live without music
And the power that’s deep in your song
You're the one and only thing I couldn’t do without
Makes me wanna sing and dance and shout

We can’t live without music
We can’t live without music
It’s a rainbow in the night
Turns darkness into light
It’s everything we really need                                     We can’t live without music
And if ever we lose it
That’s when everybody, just everybody
Starts getting the blues (We can’t live without music)
‘Cause it’s freedom to me and to you

[Bridge]
So let the music touch your heart
In times when men are worlds apart
‘Cause only love can heal the dream
That’s hidden in our souls
And hand in hand we’ll walk along
We’ll be united by a peaceful song
And we’ll live all together

Gives me hope when I’m a-cryin'

I was totally wrong

It will take you higher
Follow your emotions
I know you'll get stronger
Listen to your heartbeat
Your feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion
I know it's inside you
How will I know
If you're fooling me
Maybe I'm wrong
But it seems, to be like
it's all just a game
And I just want us to be lovers

Come shoot me with your arrow
Right through this heart of mine

I'll walk the straight and narrow
So hit me when I say -
Oooh Angel - fly me away

Seemed longer than it ever really was
How could I know
I realised as time went by I had to try
The world outside was mine
You let me go
So I left and tried to find my way to paradise
The winding road that led me there was life
I'm on my own again
Left all alone where I belong
I'm on my own again
Left all alone
Now I've seen it all
I wouldn't change a day
When curtains fall
I'd do my show
So at last I know
I've found my one true paradise
The winding road that led me there was life
I'm on my own again
Left all alone where I belong
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own
On my own, on my own

Nature's child lays beside a mother's broken heart
We stand denied the power and glory
Bitterness can't feed the hungry, hate just leaves us cold
It's time to change it
 
I lit a candle in a dream I thought I heard
Liberated voices crying freedom
Open hearts, open doors in truth and honesty
Let wisdom be the guiding light
 
Celebrate the new millennium of love
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe we all have the answer
 
A cloud can hide a mountain
And a face can hide the pain
Search until you find the answer
There is no reason
Who can understand man's inhumanity to man?

Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in you

To the rhythm of one

Turns my fire to smoke

Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Let me laugh, let me cry
Let me burn in your fire
In flames of desire
Be my river of hope
My mountain of truth
Let me colour your life

Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Take me into your arms
Spin the magic of love

My desire runs deep
And I'm losing sleep
I wake up to the light

Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn't keep from staring back at you

Say you're glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon

2000,18,18,20,Finland,Nina Åström,A Little Bit,"I'm in love with the place where I was born
Where I lived my life in harmony with every new dawn
I'm in love with the people that I know
With whom I share my tears of laughter, the times I feel low

It's a little bit of love, it's a little love I need
To keep me going, keep me smiling
It's love that makes me breathe
It may be Finland, France or Spain
Berlin, Prague or Rome
It's the place where you live
Where your heart feels at home

There's a world that is bigger than my own
Where they strive to try and unify, to dull monotone
Every change that really matters comes from within
When in love we stand together through thick and thin

It's a little bit of love, it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It's love that makes us breathe
It may be Amsterdam or Bern
Sweden or U.K
Where your heart is at home
You will feel okay                                                 (It's a little bit of love), it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It's love that makes us breathe
It's a little bit of love, it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It is love that makes us breathe

To keep us going, keep us smiling
It is love that makes us breathe"
2000,20,14,16,Switzerland,Jane Bogaert,La Vita Cos'è?,"Mi sveglio al mattino
Il caffè ancora caldo di ieri
La pioggia sulla finestra
Che legge nei miei pensieri

Mi chiedo dove sei amore lontano
Il telefono non ha suonato
Quel tuo sorriso mi fa impazzire
Non posso più aspettare

So che non era facile, il cuore mio così fragile
Si accende in un momento e vola via con il vento
Mi sento una piccola onda nel mare, azzurro dell'amore
Adesso nei miei giorni ci sei tu

La vita cos'è? La vita dov'è?
Una spina nel cuore che mi crea dolore
Se tu non ci sei

La vita dov'è? La vita cos'è?
Un palco d'amore ma l'applauso non c'é
Se tu non ci sei

Dividi con me il mondo, fammi vivere ogni giorno
Per restare accesa come la luce di una stella
Vivere un amore nel cielo, non c'è una cosa più bella
Stringimi più forte, baciami             La vita cos'è? La vita dov'è?
Una spina nel cuore che mi crea dolore
Se tu non ci sei

La vita dov'è? La vita cos'è?
Un palco d'amore ma l'applauso non c'é
Se tu non ci sei

Se tu non ci sei"
2000,21,8,11,Cyprus,Voice,Nomiza,"Ha perduto tutto quanto
Ho ferito e dopo ho pianto tanto
Infiammato dal tuo amore
Io dimentico l'onore, brucio

Μα όλα αυτά που μας αγγίζουν
Πόσο ακόμα μας χωρίζουν, πόσο
Διαφορετικούς μας θέλει
Η ζωή και περιμένει, πόσο;

Νόμιζα πως μπορώ κάποιο τρόπο να βρω
Να ενώσω αυτά που μας 'θελαν μακριά
Rosso vivo, lo sai, è la fiamma che è in noi
Non si spegnerà mai, causerà tanti guai

Ho cercato di smorzare
Emozioni da ignorare, lievi
Όπως είναι, είναι ένταξει
Κι ότι είσαι δεν θα αλλάξει ο χρόνος

Α... νόμιζα πως μπορώ κάποιο τρόπο να βρω
Να ενώσω αυτά που μας 'θελαν μακριά
Νόμιζα η καρδιά είχε πάντα πρωτιά
Κι όμως φεύγω εγώ, ναι ακόμα σ' αγαπώ (Σ' αγαπώ)
Ναι, yeah...
Νόμιζα πως μπορώ κάποιο τρόπο να βρω             Νόμιζα... νόμιζα...
Νανανά... νανανά... νανανά... α α α...

Νόμιζα η καρδιά είχε πάντα πρωτιά
Κι όμως φεύγω εγώ, ναι ακόμα σ' αγαπώ"

2000,23,5,5,France,Sofia Mestari,On Aura Le Ciel,"Et dans tes yeux, mes yeux, plonger, traverser l'océan
Poser enfin la main sur toi
Et dans tes bras, mes bras, tomber, emportée par l'élan
Laisser enfin glisser mes doigts
On aura le ciel
Un peu des anges, les ailes, on s'envole, toi et moi
On aura le miel
Un goût d'orange, cannelle, on s'envole toi et moi
Et sur ta peau, ma peau salée, savourer les moments
La nuit, flâner enfin un peu sur toi, mon bébé
Et sur ton cœur, mon cœur, briller, déposer un diamant
La nuit, penser enfin un peu à moi
On aura le ciel
Un peu des anges, les ailes, on s'envole, toi et moi
On aura le miel
Un goût d'orange, cannelle, on s'envole toi et moi
Oh, se jouer des nuages sous le ciel bleu, mon bébé
Se jouer des nuages sous le ciel bleu
On aura le soleil au fond des yeux, mon bébé
On aura le soleil au fond des yeux
Et sur ton cœur, mon cœur, léger, emporté par le vent
Oh, toi et moi
On aura le ciel
Un peu des anges, les ailes, on s'envole, toi et moi
On aura le miel
Un goût d'orange, cannelle, on s'envole, toi et moi
On aura le ciel
(Et sur ta peau, ma peau salée, savourer les moments)
On s'envole toi et moi
On aura le miel
(Et sur ton cœur, mon cœur, briller, déposer un diamant)
S'envole toi et moi
On aura le ciel
Un peu des anges, les ailes, on s'envole, toi et moi
On aura le miel
Un goût d'orange, cannelle, on s'envole, toi et moi"
2000,24,2,10,Belgium,Nathalie Sorce,Envie De Vivre,"Comment vivre sans amour?
Comment vivre sans amour?
Comment vivre l'envie de vivre?
Au delà des pensées, au delà de l'amour
Il nous faut partager bien autre chose chaque jour
Sous les foudres du temps en colère depuis deux mille ans
Ce qui reste debout, ce n'est pas nous
Entre le bien, le mal, bien d'autres sentiments
Suivent la seule étoile à la gloire du Dieu vivant
A travers les passions et défiant toutes les saisons
Ce qui reste debout ce n'est pas nous, mais
L'envie de vivre pour l'eternité
L'envie de vivre nous a dépassés
L'envie de vivre restera gravée
Comme dans un livre qu'on a oublié
Mais on ne peut survivre dans un monde sans amour
Les portes de la vie en auront besoin chaque jour
Comment pourrait-on voir un sourire dans chaque regard
Si la case départ est dénuée de tout espoir?
Alors je veux vivre, vivre pour donner
L'envie de vivre et l'envie d'aimer"
