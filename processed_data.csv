When the stars align, then I'll be there
No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
No, I don't care about the pain

2023,4,350,11,Italy,Marco Mengoni,Due Vite,"Siamo i soli svegli in tutto l'universo
E non conosco ancora bene il tuo deserto
Forse è in un posto del mio cuore dove il sole è sempre spento
Dove a volte ti perdo, ma se voglio ti prendo
Siamo fermi in un tempo così, che solleva le strade
Con il cielo ad un passo da qui, siamo i mostri e le fate
Dovrei telefonarti, dirti le cose che sento
Ma ho finito le scuse e non ho più difese
Siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra
Il caffè col limone contro l'hangover, sembri una foto mossa
E ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale
E meno male
Se questa è l'ultima canzone e poi la luna esploderà
Sarò lì a dirti che sbagli, ti sbagli e lo sai
Qui non arriva la musica
E tu non dormi e dove sarai? Dove vai?
Quando la vita poi esagera
Tutte le corse, gli schiaffi, gli sbagli che fai
Quando qualcosa ti agita
Tanto lo so che tu non dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi, dormi mai
Che giri fanno due vite
Siamo i soli svegli in tutto l'universo
A gridare un po' di rabbia sopra un tetto
Che nessuno si sente così
Che nessuno li guarda più i film
I fiori nella tua camera
La mia maglia metallica
Siamo un libro sul pavimento in una casa vuota che sembra la nostra
Persi tra le persone, quante parole senza mai una risposta
E ci siamo fottuti ancora una notte fuori un locale

Quando la vita poi esagera
Tutte le corse, gli schiaffi, gli sbagli che fai
Quando qualcosa ti agita
Tanto lo so che tu non dormi
Spegni la luce anche se non ti va
Restiamo al buio avvolti solo dal suono della voce
Al di là della follia che balla in tutte le cose
Due vite, guarda che disordine
Se questa è l'ultima (canzone e poi la luna esploderà) canzone
Sarò lì a dirti che sbagli, ti sbagli e lo sai
Qui non arriva la musica

toutes ces belles promesses que j'entends
c'n'est que du vent
évidemment
elle ne sera plus jamais la même
cette fille d'avant
car moi, je chante
ma vie, la vôtre et un peu de romance
je suis nue devant vous
donnez-moi donc une chance
de vous à moi, de moi à vous
ai-je réussi à chanter
à chanter la grande france?
c'est toujours trop beau pour être vrai, mais
c'n'est jamais trop laid pour être faux

e ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
e ti vorrei rubare un cielo di perle
e pagherei per andar via
accetterei anche una bugia
e ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
e mi vengono i brividi, brividi, brividi
dimmi che non ho ragione
e vivo dentro una prigione
e provo a restarti vicino
ma scusa se poi mando tutto a puttane e
non so dirti ciò che provo, è un mio limite
per un ""ti amo"" ho mischiato droghe e lacrime
questo veleno che ci sputiamo ogni giorno
io non lo voglio più addosso
lo vedi, sono qui
su una bici di diamanti, uno fra tanti
nudo con i brividi
a volte non so esprimermi
e ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
e ti vorrei rubare un cielo di perle
e pagherei per andar via
accetterei anche una bugia
e ti vorrei amare, ma sbaglio sempre
e mi vengono i brividi, brividi, brividi

I tried to make it go away, but it probably won't change
Always thinking 'bout my own worries
Remember back when we had no worries?
Now life just ain't hitting the same
I sit and miss and reminisce about innocent old days
When I was afraid of nobody

It finds a way in nonetheless
Wish I could change my address
And you know
Just be somebody else for a couple of days

So exhausted, always caught up inside my doubts and flaws
And I'ma count them all

they keep saying it'll never get better
look where we are
we used to be the rockstars
who never thought of no harm
'til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
i wish there was a way to go back dreaming
remembering gets so hard
when time is moving so fast
wish there was a way to know that we're in
the good old days before we all just leave 'em
sometimes i got this kinda sting that's right inside my chest
its only purpose is convincing me that i'm a mess
and even though it's always been an uninvited guest
it finds a way in nonetheless
wish i could change my address
and you know
just be somebody else for a couple of days
although i'm pretty sure we all feel the same kinda way
'cause if you think about it
aren't we all set in a place
where we look back at better days
and wish they weren't so far away?
i wish that i could just go back and be the way i was
i wish i'd still not give a damn 'bout how i come across
i wish the way i saw myself had never gotten lost
in all the worries, all the thoughts, overthinking all the parts
so exhausted, always caught up inside my doubts and flaws
and i'ma count them all
somebody catch me, i'm 'bout to fall
yeah, i'm 'bout to fall
can we press pause?
or do a restart
and be who we are?
we used to be the rockstars
who never thought of no harm
'til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
i wish there was a way to go back dreaming
remembering gets so hard
when time is moving so fast
wish there was a way to know that we're in
the good old days before we all just leave 'em
didn't we?

Porque yo voy a quedarme
","quédate esta noche para ver amanecer
para sentir tu voz acariciándome
quédate un segundo más, no hay nada que perder
mientras dibujo un mar de memorias en tu piel
he bajado el cielo para descubrir
qué se esconde en tu mirada
solo a unos centímetros de mí
voy a quedarme y prometo
quererte más que ayer
voy a besarte muy lento
como la primera vez
y dejar atrás el miedo
con tu alma entre mis dedos
quédate
porque yo voy a quedarme
sé que hay muchos como yo, con tanto que ofrecer
pero juro que este amor nadie lo podrá vencer
y aunque nuestro baile diera un paso marcha atrás
no te preocupes, yo contigo siempre bailaré
¿qué más da si el mundo se derrumba hoy?
¿o qué pasará mañana?
que yo de tu lado no me voy
voy a quedarme y prometo
quererte más que ayer
voy a besarte muy lento
como la primera vez
y dejar atrás el miedo
con tu alma entre mis dedos
quédate
porque yo voy a quedarme
a tu lado aunque nos tiemble el suelo
se apague el sol, se caiga el cielo
a tan solo unos centímetros los dos
y dejar atrás el miedo
con tu alma entre mis dedos
quédate

Il sole sulla Rambla oggi non è lo stesso
In Francia c’è un concerto
la gente si diverte
qualcuno canta forte
qualcuno grida a morte

A Londra piove sempre ma oggi non fa male
il cielo non fa sconti neanche a un funerale
A Nizza il mare è rosso di fuochi e di vergogna
di gente sull’asfalto e sangue nella fogna

E questo corpo enorme che noi chiamiamo Terra
ferito nei suoi organi dall’Asia all’Inghilterra
galassie di persone disperse nello spazio
ma quello più importante è lo spazio di un abbraccio
Di madri senza figli, di figli senza padri
Di volti illuminati come muri senza quadri
Minuti di silenzio spezzati da una voce
Non mi avete fatto niente

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non mi avete tolto niente
Questa è la mia vita che va avanti
oltre tutto, oltre la gente
Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre

C’è chi si fa la croce
e chi prega sui tappeti
le chiese e le moschee
l’Imàm e tutti i preti
Gli ingressi separati della stessa casa
Miliardi di persone che sperano in qualcosa
Braccia senza mani
Facce senza nomi
Scambiamoci la pelle
in fondo siamo umani
Perché la nostra vita non è un punto di vista
E non esiste bomba pacifista

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non mi avete tolto niente
Questa è la mia vita che va avanti
Oltre tutto, oltre la gente
Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre

Cadranno i grattaceli
e le metropolitane
i muri di contrasto alzati per il pane
ma contro ogni terrore che ostacola il cammino
il mondo si rialza
col sorriso di un bambino
col sorriso di un bambino
col sorriso di un bambino

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente
Perché tutto va oltre le vostre inutili guerre
Non mi avete fatto niente
Le vostre inutili guerre
Non avete avuto niente
Le vostre inutili guerre

Sono consapevole che tutto più non torna
La felicità volava
Come vola via una bolla
","al cairo non lo sanno che ore sono adesso
il sole sulla rambla oggi non è lo stesso
in francia c’è un concerto
la gente si diverte
qualcuno canta forte
qualcuno grida a morte

a londra piove sempre ma oggi non fa male
il cielo non fa sconti neanche a un funerale
a nizza il mare è rosso di fuochi e di vergogna
di gente sull’asfalto e sangue nella fogna

e questo corpo enorme che noi chiamiamo terra
ferito nei suoi organi dall’asia all’inghilterra
galassie di persone disperse nello spazio
ma quello più importante è lo spazio di un abbraccio
di madri senza figli, di figli senza padri
di volti illuminati come muri senza quadri
minuti di silenzio spezzati da una voce
non mi avete fatto niente

non mi avete fatto niente
non mi avete tolto niente
questa è la mia vita che va avanti

Prima mi chiudevo in una scatola
Sempre un po' distante dalle cose della vita
Perché così profondamente non l'avevo mai sentita

E non sentire più tensione solo vita dentro di me

but now you´re running from the past
let´s find a way to carry on
remember how love used to be
you said i was your fantasy
can´t take another night alone
so come on home

hold me
just unfold me
unchain my soul
give me love make me whole
hold me
if it´s only
for this moment in time
now i´m yours and your mine
so hold me
hold me – hold me…",en,0

Και η πλόρη μας τραβάει για Γρεβενά

But to make your way through cold and heat
Love is all that you need

More than anything I heard
But I was too scared to lose my fun
I began to cry a lot
And she gave me apricots
Kisses of the earth, fruits of the sun

Hidden in my hand

From the motherland

Shining brightly in the storm
And I've got an avatar
Of my love to keep me warm
Now I'm not afraid of violent winds
They may blow - they can't win

May the winter stay away
From my harvest night and day
May God bless and keep my cherished fruit
Grow my tree up to the sky
Once I waved my home goodbye
I just want to go back to my roots

to be bullied and i'll tell you now it isn't nice,
It isn't nice wouldn't wish it upon anyone,
so i'll tell you my story and my story from how it begun

Moved to Blackpool thought it was a nice place
Moved to a school at first yeah it was great
Got along with people and I had all my new friends,
turned out they were snakes, bullies in the end
And I, was a new girl that rumors went around
Shouting as they all walked past her
From here it all went down
Now the people turned against me
And now I lost all my mates
And I lost everyone there wasn't much more I could take and I,
got called names as I walked along the corridor
Weeks passed got worse couldn't take it anymore
Ran away, put my mum through so much stress
But my story doesn't end yet you haven't heard the rest
I was lost and had nobody put my mind to the test,
but my story doesn't end yeah you haven't heard the rest
Ran away, put my mum through so much stress
But my story doesn't end yet you haven't heard the rest
[Hook x2]

Keep on fighting,
cause every cloud has a silver lining
Gotta be strong be a soldier,
forget what them bullies told ya

[Verse 2]

Got messages often saying I should die,
and by this point I had enough of my life
So I got into the bedroom, locked the door,
got hold of all these tablets,
took loads and took some more
It was an overdose, and I didn't tell anyone
No one noticed till the morning didn't realise what I'd done
Saw that look in my mum's eyes
That look I'd never forget,
and then my mind fills with emotion,
and then it fills with regret
She was scared shocked and I didn't know what to do
So we phoned an ambulance, didn't wanna tell the truth,
and we informed the school,
seems it didn't care
So they put me in a room everyday, it weren't fair
Why did I get all the punishment for all that I've been through?
When you get something like this
You think it's taken from you,
Months later..
Things didn't change I would self harm,
Run away still full of pain but,
This was my fight and I weren't gonna lose
Thought it would be hard in the end it's just a bruise
Now I'm the girl, with one million views,
and I've learnt to ignore to the people who will disapprove
Don't judge a book by it's cover,
because you don't know what you'll find
I'm Sophie Aspin and this story is mine

Swept me away, make me lose control
Like never before.

Of my very soul.

I just hope this isn't a dream
And that you are reality.

I admit I fell for you so badly
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes that I am looking foolish
I admit, I admit
I'll be a fool as long as you are mine
Mine, just mine, just mine.

It's great to be in love
It makes me touch the sky
A thousand times or more.

It's good to admit
That my heart starts to race
When you walk through that door.

You’re the rhythm of my heartbeat at night

You're the only melody that's in my soul

That’s when everybody, just everybody
Starts getting the blues (We can’t live without music)

And we’ll live all together

Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn't keep from staring back at you

[Chorus]
My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don't you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you're glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
My heart goes boom

[Verse 2]
Summer, Saturday, and sunset
You said hello and I said hi, and something lit the evening sky
You came out of the shadows
With a teasing twinkle in your eye and took my senses for a ride                    [Pre-Chorus]

Something slow in perfect tune
Half a smile as you sat down
I couldn't seem to keep my eyes off you

quel tuo sorriso mi fa impazzire
non posso più aspettare

so che non era facile, il cuore mio così fragile
si accende in un momento e vola via con il vento
mi sento una piccola onda nel mare, azzurro dell'amore
adesso nei miei giorni ci sei tu

la vita cos'è? la vita dov'è?
una spina nel cuore che mi crea dolore
se tu non ci sei

la vita dov'è? la vita cos'è?
un palco d'amore ma l'applauso non c'é
se tu non ci sei

dividi con me il mondo, fammi vivere ogni giorno
per restare accesa come la luce di una stella
vivere un amore nel cielo, non c'è una cosa più bella
stringimi più forte, baciami             la vita cos'è? la vita dov'è?
una spina nel cuore che mi crea dolore
se tu non ci sei

la vita dov'è? la vita cos'è?
un palco d'amore ma l'applauso non c'é
se tu non ci sei

se tu non ci sei",it,3

Ho ferito e dopo ho pianto tanto
Infiammato dal tuo amore
Io dimentico l'onore, brucio

Μα όλα αυτά που μας αγγίζουν
Πόσο ακόμα μας χωρίζουν, πόσο
Διαφορετικούς μας θέλει
Η ζωή και περιμένει, πόσο;

Νόμιζα πως μπορώ κάποιο τρόπο να βρω
Να ενώσω αυτά που μας 'θελαν μακριά
Rosso vivo, lo sai, è la fiamma che è in noi
Non si spegnerà mai, causerà tanti guai

Ho cercato di smorzare
Emozioni da ignorare, lievi
Όπως είναι, είναι ένταξει
Κι ότι είσαι δεν θα αλλάξει ο χρόνος

Comment vivre sans amour?
Comment vivre l'envie de vivre?
Au delà des pensées, au delà de l'amour
Il nous faut partager bien autre chose chaque jour
Sous les foudres du temps en colère depuis deux mille ans
Ce qui reste debout, ce n'est pas nous
Entre le bien, le mal, bien d'autres sentiments
Suivent la seule étoile à la gloire du Dieu vivant
A travers les passions et défiant toutes les saisons
Ce qui reste debout ce n'est pas nous, mais
L'envie de vivre pour l'eternité
L'envie de vivre nous a dépassés
L'envie de vivre restera gravée
Comme dans un livre qu'on a oublié
Mais on ne peut survivre dans un monde sans amour

Si la case départ est dénuée de tout espoir?
